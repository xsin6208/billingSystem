# billingSystem
Automated Health Track Billing system which determines and creates invoices to be sent to Health Funds based on procedure information from documents. 

This was completed as a personal project where I identified potential for a software system to expedite the current billing processes and reduce overall errors. From there I researched on potential ways to extract information from documents and to automate human actions on a computer. I spent about 80 hours all up of my spare time to create this system and to ensure it was of high quality able to adapt to all potential edge cases. 

I incorporated this system into my workplace and through my work the practice found efficiencies in this process boost by about three times the amount. Errors in billing also reduced to near 0. 

This project demonstrates the ways in which exisiting processes can be expedited through emerging technology especially document AI. It also acknowledges the desire for health professionals to have their administrative concerns controlled and organised as best as possible so that they can focus on the more important parts of their work such as caring for patients and developing solutions to their medical issues.
